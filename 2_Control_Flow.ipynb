    " - The Python `if` keyword performs a conditional test on an expression for a Boolean value of True or False.\n",
    " - Alternatives to an `if` test are provided using `elif` and `else` tests.\n",
    " - A `while` loop repeats until a test expression returns `False`.\n",
    " - A `for`...`in`... loop iterates over each item in a specified data structure (or string).\n",
    " - The `range()` function generates a numerical sequence that can be used to specify the length of the `for` loop.\n",
    " - The `break` and `continue` keywords interrupt loop iterations."
